# 1.1 Linux Evolution and Popular Operating Systems

This document summarizes the history of Linux, the components that make up the operating system, and the main families of distributions that exist today.

## Origins: The Grandfather, UNIX

The history of Linux is intrinsically linked to **UNIX**.

* **What is it?** A powerful, multi-user, multi-tasking operating system created at Bell Labs in the 1970s.
* **Its Importance:** It is the **primary inspiration** for Linux. Many of the concepts, tools, and directory structures in Linux are a reimplementation of ideas from UNIX. For the certification, it's crucial to know that Linux is a **"UNIX-like"** system.

## The Key Pieces of the Puzzle

The operating system we know as "Linux" was not created by a single person. It was formed by the union of two massive projects with different philosophies that converged at the perfect moment.

### Richard Stallman and the GNU Project

* **Who:** Richard Stallman, a programmer and free software activist.
* **What:** The **GNU Project** ("GNU's Not Unix!"), started in 1983.
* **Objective:** To create a **completely free** operating system, where users would have total control over their software.
* **Achievements:** By the early 1990s, the GNU project had developed almost all the necessary components: a compiler (`GCC`), a command-line interpreter (`bash`), an editor (`Emacs`), and hundreds of other utilities.
* **The Problem:** They were missing the most critical piece: a functional **kernel**.

### Linus Torvalds and the Linux Kernel

* **Who:** Linus Torvalds, a computer science student in Finland.
* **What:** In **1991**, as a personal hobby project, he created a **kernel** from scratch, inspired by **MINIX** (an academic version of UNIX).
* **The Spark:** Linus released the source code of his kernel on the internet, and a global community of developers began to collaborate to improve it.

## The Great Union: GNU/Linux

The most fundamental concept you must master is this:

> The operating system is the combination of the **Linux kernel** (created by Linus Torvalds) and the set of **tools and programs from the GNU Project**.

* **Analogy:** The **Linux kernel is the engine** of a car. The **GNU tools are the chassis**, the steering wheel, and the wheels. You need both to have a functional vehicle.
* For this reason, the most accurate way to refer to the operating system is **GNU/Linux**.

## Core Concepts for the Exam

* **Kernel:** The core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the hardware (CPU, memory, devices) and processes. It's the intermediary between the software and the hardware.
* **Shell:** The command-line interface (`CLI`) that allows the user to communicate with the kernel. The most common one is **`bash`**, which is part of the GNU project.
* **Distribution (Distro):** The complete package that a user installs. It contains the **Linux kernel**, **GNU tools**, a **package manager**, a desktop environment (like GNOME or KDE), and additional software.

## The Current Ecosystem: A Map of Distributions

Distributions are commonly grouped into "families" based on their origin and, most importantly, their package management system.

### 1. The Debian Family

* **Package Management:** Uses the `apt` manager and `.deb` packages.
* **Philosophy:** Known for its stability and massive software repositories.
* **Examples:**
    * **Debian:** The foundation, very stable.
    * **Ubuntu:** Based on Debian, highly popular for desktops and servers.
    * **Linux Mint:** Based on Ubuntu, focused on ease of use.
    * **Kali Linux:** Based on Debian, specialized in cybersecurity.

### 2. The RPM-Based Enterprise Families

This group, dominant in the corporate sector, uses the `.rpm` package format.

* **The Red Hat Branch:**
    * **Package Management:** Uses the `yum` and `dnf` managers.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL):** The commercial, supported version.
        * **Fedora:** The community-driven, innovative, and cutting-edge version (the "testing ground" for RHEL).
        * **CentOS:** Historically a RHEL clone, now an upstream development version (Stream).

* **The SUSE Branch:**
    * **Package Management:** Uses the `zypper` manager (though it also understands `yum`).
    * **Philosophy:** German in origin, it's a powerhouse in the European enterprise sector.
    * **Examples:**
        * **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES):** The commercial version.
        * **openSUSE:** The community version.

### 3. The Independent Way

These distributions were built from scratch and do not derive from the main families.

* **Arch Linux:**
    * **Package Management:** Uses `pacman`.
    * **Philosophy:** "The Arch Way" - simplicity, user control, and a *rolling release* model (always up-to-date, no discrete versions).
    * **Derivatives:** **Manjaro** is based on Arch but is pre-configured to be more beginner-friendly.

### A Special Case: Android

* Google's mobile operating system, **Android**, **uses the Linux kernel**. It is not a traditional GNU/Linux distribution, but its core is Linux. **This is a very frequent exam question!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Points for the Certification

* **Linus Torvalds** created the **Linux kernel** in **1991**.
* **Richard Stallman** started the **GNU Project** to create a free operating system.
* A **GNU/Linux** Operating System = **The Linux Kernel** + **GNU Tools**.
* A **Distribution** is the complete, installable package.
* For the exam, you must master the two main families: **Debian** (uses `apt` and `.deb`) and **Red Hat** (uses `dnf`/`yum` and `.rpm`).
* **Android DOES use the Linux kernel.**
* Linux was inspired by **UNIX**.
